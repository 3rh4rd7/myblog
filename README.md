# ðŸ“š Learning Project for Yandex

This is a basic learning project designed for deployment in a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat).

## ðŸ”§ How to Build

The project uses Maven Wrapper, so you don't need to have Maven installed on your system.

```bash
# On Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS)
./mvnw clean package

# On Windows
mvnw.cmd clean package
```

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

```bash
# On Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS)
./mvnw clean test

# On Windows
mvnw.cmd clean test
```

## ðŸš€ How to Deploy
1. Build the project:

```bash
# On Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS)
./mvnw clean package

# On Windows
mvnw.cmd clean package
```
2. Copy the WAR file:
Locate app.war in the app/target directory and copy it to your servlet container's webapps folder:

```bash
cp app/target/app.war /path/to/tomcat/webapps/
```

3. Create a temporary uploads folder (used for handling file uploads):

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /tmp/uploads
sudo chmod 777 /tmp/uploads
```

## ðŸ“‹ Maven Wrapper

This project includes Maven Wrapper, which allows you to build the project without having Maven installed globally. The wrapper scripts (`mvnw` for Unix-based systems and `mvnw.cmd` for Windows) will automatically download the correct version of Maven if it's not already present on your system.

### Using Maven Wrapper

- To see the Maven version: `./mvnw -v` or `mvnw.cmd -v`
- To clean the project: `./mvnw clean` or `mvnw.cmd clean`
- To compile the project: `./mvnw compile` or `mvnw.cmd compile`
- To package the project: `./mvnw package` or `mvnw.cmd package`
- To run tests: `./mvnw test` or `mvnw.cmd test`

The first time you run a command, the wrapper will download the appropriate Maven distribution. Subsequent runs will use the downloaded version.
